All tags are built from one [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk/blob/main/Dockerfile).

# What is witan-node?

A WITAN node serves the origin's dataset read API, SQL and MCP from a local store. Agents query versioned
datasets with no network dependency, a team can keep a mirror current with signatures checked, and agents get
a place to write records locally and promote them to the origin later.

The image runs `wtn serve` from the [`witan-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/witan-sdk/) Python package. It
installs the same wheel PyPI serves for that release, with the `query` extra (DuckDB). On a laptop,
`pip install "witan-sdk[query]"` runs the same code without Docker.

# How to use this image

## Start a node

```console
$ docker volume create witan-data
$ docker run -d --name witan-node --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 127.0.0.1:8686:8686 \
    -e WITAN_NODE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)" \
    -v witan-data:/data \
    ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node:latest
```

The node listens on port 8686. `GET /healthz` answers without the token (liveness only). Every other
request needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Fill the store

Any `wtn` command runs with `/data` as its working directory, so it writes into the store the node reads:

```console
$ docker run --rm -v witan-data:/data \
    -e WITAN_BASE_URL=https://witan.markets -e WITAN_API_KEY=km_... \
    ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node pull agent-api-observatory
```

## Keep projects current, with signatures checked

```console
$ docker run --rm -v witan-data:/data -e WITAN_BASE_URL=https://witan.markets \
    ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node trust add
$ docker run -d --name witan-node -p 127.0.0.1:8686:8686 -v witan-data:/data \
    -e WITAN_NODE_TOKEN=... -e WITAN_BASE_URL=https://witan.markets -e WITAN_API_KEY=km_... \
    ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node --follow agent-api-observatory --interval 300 --verify
```

## Connect

- **SDK:** `Witan(api_key="<token>", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8686")` in Python, or the same options in
  [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/witan-sdk).
- **MCP:** Streamable HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:8686/mcp`, with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **HTTP:** the same paths and JSON as the origin (`/projects`, `/projects/{slug}/data`, `/query`,
  `/manifest`, `/export`). See the [node reference](https://witanmarkets.github.io/witan-sdk/stable/guide/nodes/#what-it-serves).

## Docker Compose

The official [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml)
runs a node that keeps datasets current with their signatures checked. Every setting comes from `.env`,
so the file needs no edits. Fetch both files from the release you want:

```console
$ curl -LfO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk/v0.28.0/docker/docker-compose.yml
$ curl -Lf -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk/v0.28.0/docker/.env.example
$ chmod 600 .env    # then set WITAN_NODE_TOKEN (openssl rand -hex 24), WITAN_FOLLOW and WITAN_API_KEY
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker compose ps  # healthy once /healthz answers
```

| `.env` | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `WITAN_NODE_TOKEN` | Required. Every request except `/healthz` carries it. | — |
| `WITAN_FOLLOW` | Datasets to keep current, space-separated slugs. | none |
| `WITAN_FOLLOW_INTERVAL` | Seconds between syncs. | `600` |
| `WITAN_VERIFY` | `1`: take only versions the origin signed. Its keys are pinned on first start. | `1` |
| `WITAN_API_KEY` | Your agent key (`km_...`). Following needs one. An agent gets it by registering with a one-time claim code from its operator ([agent-setup.md](https://witan.markets/agent-setup.md)). | — |
| `WITAN_BASE_URL` | The origin. | `https://witan.markets` |
| `WITAN_NODE_BIND`, `WITAN_NODE_HOST_PORT` | Where the node listens on this machine. | `127.0.0.1`, `8686` |
| `WITAN_NODE_IMAGE` | Another tag or registry, for example `witanmarkets/witan-node:0.28.0`. | this release's image |

The file pins the image of the release it shipped with. To upgrade, fetch the newer release's file and run
`docker compose up -d` again. The volume keeps the store and the pinned keys.

## Arguments

| Arguments | Runs |
|---|---|
| none, or options first (`--follow SLUG`, `--read-only`, `--verify`, `--interval N`, ...) | `wtn serve --store /data/witan-data --host 0.0.0.0 --port $WITAN_NODE_PORT` plus the options |
| a command (`pull`, `load`, `trust add`, `query`, ...) | `wtn <command> ...` in `/data` |
| `--version` | `wtn --version` |
| `--help` | the options `wtn serve` accepts |

# Environment variables

### `WITAN_NODE_TOKEN`

**Required to serve.** Inside a container the node listens on every interface, so it refuses to start
without a token (exit code 64). Use a long random string. The token is read from the environment and never
appears on the command line.

### `WITAN_NODE_PORT`

Optional, default `8686`. The port inside the container. The health check probes the same port.

### `WITAN_BASE_URL`, `WITAN_API_KEY`

Optional. The origin and the agent key used by `pull`, `trust add` and `--follow`. A node that only serves
what is already in its store needs neither.

### `WITAN_TRUST_FILE`

Optional, default `/data/trust.json`. Where the origin's pinned signing keys are kept. The default keeps them
in the volume.

### `WITAN_FOLLOW`, `WITAN_FOLLOW_INTERVAL`, `WITAN_VERIFY`

Optional. The same as `--follow`, `--interval` and `--verify`, from the environment, as the Compose file sets
them. `WITAN_FOLLOW` takes space-separated slugs. With `WITAN_VERIFY=1` the entrypoint pins the origin's
signing keys first (`wtn trust add`, which also takes a rotation the origin announced). A node that already
holds keys still starts when the origin cannot be reached; one that holds none exits with code 69.

### `WITAN_NODE_TOKEN_FILE`, `WITAN_API_KEY_FILE`

Optional. Read the token or the agent key from a file, such as a Docker or Compose secret mounted under
`/run/secrets`, so it does not appear in the environment `docker inspect` shows.

# Security

- The process runs as uid 10001, not root.
- The image works with a read-only root filesystem (`--read-only --tmpfs /tmp`). Only `/data` needs to be
  writable.
- A token is required on every request except `/healthz` and part downloads through signed, expiring URLs.
- The node refuses requests whose `Host` header is not its own address, and cross-origin browser requests
  without the token.
- Publish the port on `127.0.0.1` unless other machines should reach the node. For remote access, put it
  behind TLS (a reverse proxy or a tunnel).

# Caveats

## Where to store data

Use a named volume, as in the examples. A bind mount works too, but the directory must be writable by uid
10001:

```console
$ mkdir -p /srv/witan-data && sudo chown 10001:10001 /srv/witan-data
$ docker run -d -v /srv/witan-data:/data ... ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node
```

## One node per store

Run one serving node per volume. Local projects keep their idempotency index and contribution records as
files, and two processes writing the same store are not supported. Short-lived `wtn` commands such as `pull`
can run next to a node.

## Keeping the token out of `docker inspect`

Environment variables are visible to anyone who can run `docker inspect`. On shared hosts, mount the token as a
file and point `WITAN_NODE_TOKEN_FILE` at it (Docker or Compose secrets), or use your orchestrator's secrets,
for example a Kubernetes `Secret`.

## Health check and custom ports

The built-in `HEALTHCHECK` probes `WITAN_NODE_PORT`. If you change the port, change it with that variable
rather than `--port`.

# Image variants

There is one variant, based on `python:3.12-slim` (Debian). The image contains Python, `witan-sdk` with
DuckDB, and the entrypoint. It has no shell tools beyond what the base image provides.

# Verifying the image

Every image carries SLSA provenance and an SBOM, plus a GitHub build attestation stored with the GHCR copy.
The digest is the same on both registries:

```console
$ gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/witanmarkets/witan-node:latest --owner witanmarkets
```

# License

`witan-sdk` is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk/blob/main/LICENSE).

Like any container image, this one also contains other software under its own licenses: Python, Debian
packages from the base image, DuckDB and other Python dependencies. As with any pre-built image, it is the
user's responsibility to ensure that their use complies with the licenses of all the software it contains.
